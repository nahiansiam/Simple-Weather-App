🌦️ Simple Weather App

This is a beginner-friendly Python Weather Application that retrieves real-time weather information for any city using an online weather 
service.
The program first takes the city name as user input, then sends a web request to a public weather API and receives data in JSON format.
After processing the response, it extracts key details such as temperature, feels-like temperature, and weather condition, and displays 
them in a clean, readable format in the terminal.
This project helps beginners understand API integration, HTTP requests, JSON data handling, and basic error management in Python.
